	abstract = {With the recent advances and increasing activities in data mining and analysis, the
	protection of the privacy of individuals is crucial. Several approaches address this
	concern, from techniques like data anonymisation to secure, non-disclosive computation,
	all of which have their specific strengths and weaknesses, depending on the specific
	requirements. A slightly different approach is the generation of synthetic data, which
	tries to preserve the overall properties and characteristics of the original data
	without revealing information about actual individual data samples. The promise is
	that, for most purposes, models trained on the synthetic data instead of the real
	data do not show a significant loss of performance. In this paper, we give an overview
	on currently available approaches for synthetic data generation, and empirically evaluate
	the utility of the generated synthetic data by testing them on a number of supervised
	machine learning tasks on several publicly available datasets.},
