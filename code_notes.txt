notes for the code for synthetic data augmentation

1 - split the data normally, train, test, validate
2 - train a GAN on the whole training data
3 - create k-folds for the underlying model
4 - iterate over the k-folds --> 
4a - fine-tune the GAN generator on the fold
4b - generate synthetic data, mix into the fold
4c - ingest the fold into the base model
5 - validate

notes - when do you stop? (with the GAN and fine tuning?)
