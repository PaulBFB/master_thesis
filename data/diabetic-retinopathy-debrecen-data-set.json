However, as exudates are represented by a set of points rather than the number of pixels constructing the lesions, these features are normalized by dividing the number of lesions with the diameter of the ROI to compensate different image sizes. 16) The euclidean distance of the center of the macula and the center of the optic disc to provide important information regarding the patient\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s condition. This feature is also normalized with the diameter of the ROI. 17) The diameter of the optic disc. 18) The binary result of the AM/FM-based classification. 19) Class label. 1 = contains signs of DR (Accumulative label for the Messidor classes 1, 2, 3), 0 = no signs of DR.", "Relevant Papers": "Provide references to papers that have cited this data set in the past (if any).", "Citation Request": ["Please cite the following paper: Balint Antal, Andras Hajdu: An ensemble-based system for automatic screening of diabetic retinopathy, Knowledge-Based Systems 60 (April 2014), 20-27.
