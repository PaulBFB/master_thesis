After giving a summary on the literature and history of neural networks, I elucidate the trade-offs between deep learning and other machine learning approaches. I show that machine learning approaches such as \ac{gb} mostly trade increased data requirements in favor of data scientist worktime in data preparation and feature engineering.
I then investigate whether more complicated \acp{nn} may be used by synthetically enlarging the training data present and thereby achieving comparable accuracy while saving data preparation time, effectively trading processing time (synthetic data enlargement being resource-intensive) for manual feature-engineering time by creating a model and benchmarking it against a \ac{gb} reference model on a standard \ac{ml} dataset.
