After giving a summary on the literature and history of other approaches for increasing training data, I elucidate the trade-offs between deep learning and other machine learning approaches. I show that advanced machine learning approaches such as \acp{nn} mostly trade increased data requirements against data scientist effort in data preparation and feature engineering on the one hand and model complexity and representational power on the other hand.

I then investigate whether more complicated \acp{nn} may be used by synthetically enlarging the training data present using \acp{GAN} and thereby achieving comparable or greater accuracy while saving data preparation time, effectively trading processing time (synthetic data enlargement being resource-intensive) for manual feature-engineering time by creating a model and benchmarking it against shallow reference models on multiple standard \ac{ml} datasets.
